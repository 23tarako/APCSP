    <p class="p">My name is Tara Kothari. I have a dog who's name is Lua and she is a white golden retriever. I live with my parents and two older brothers. I love languages and cooking food from around the world. I also have played volleyball since 4th grade. I've been playing piano since I was 3, and sing for the Piedmont Troubadours.
